Step1, you need to use the "patch file.py" to generate "T1patches_sameneighbor.mat" and "T2patches_sameneighbor.mat",
and corresponding true label names "truelabel.mat", and then save them.
Step2, you need to use the "patch.m" to generate samples, here I save these samples in "D:\Poyang\matsamples\patchdata\Samples_pca_patch_truelabel_sameneighbor\", you can change it.
Step3, you need to use the "noaug_patch_truelabel.py" to split all samples which are generated by step 2 and save them to your folder.
Step4, after Step3 you can get four files in your folder, then you can use "patch_cnn_train.py" to train CNN.
Step5, after training you can use the "patch_test_predict.py" to evaluate this method.
